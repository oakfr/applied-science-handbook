Software is eating the world and AI is eating software. Generative AI is turning the world upside down, with potentially dramatically positive effects for the world. But we won't change the world with AI if we don't make it work for the Product. 

Over the course of my career, I had the great chance to work with highly talented people across various industries. I'd like to share some principles that I have seen work consistently in the field of Applied AI. 

This book is the *operating system* for an Applied AI team. 

Whether you run a small startup or a large company, whether you are a practitioner or a leader, this book should help you navigate the world of Applied AI. 

Fasten your seat belt, and read on!
