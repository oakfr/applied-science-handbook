Software is eating the world and AI is eating software. Generative AI is turning the world upside down, with potentially dramatically positive effects for the world. But we won't change the world with AI if we don't make it work for the product. I had the great chance to work with highly talented people across many industries. I'd like to share some principles that I have seen work consistently in the field of Applied AI. 

Whether you run a small startup or a large company, whether you are a practitioner or a leader, this book should help you navigate the world of Applied AI. 

 

This work is the summary of years of experience. I realized that the time had come to bring all of them together into a cohesive handbook of Applied AI. Fasten your seat belt, and read on! 

# About me

Olivier spent the last 14 years building and running Applied AI teams across a variety of domains: five years in the defense industry at Thales, six years in the online advertising business at Criteo, and more recently, three years in online identity verification at Onfido. 

 

Throughout these years, Olivier discovered numerous practices in Applied AI, just as the field was taking the world by storm with deep learning and generative AI. During his time at MIT, Olivier was part of the MIT DARPA Urban Challenge Team. With his team, he built a self-driving car from scratch and reached the 4th place at the Grand Finale in Victorville, CA. 

 

Olivier holds a PhD in Computer Science from MIT and an engineering degree from ENSTA ParisTech. He has published work in international conferences (CVPR, ICCV, IJFR, ICRA). He holds several patents and speaks at international venues regularly.â€¯
