Software is eating the world and AI is eating software. Generative AI is now turning the world upside down, with dramatic effects for the world. But we won't change the world with AI if we don't make it work for the Product. 

Over the course of my career, I had the great chance to apply AI with highly talented people across various industries. 

This book is the result of all these years: the *operating system* for successful Applied AI teams.

Whether you run a small startup or a large company, whether you are a practitioner or a leader, this book should help you navigate the world of Applied AI. 

Fasten your seat belt, and read on!
