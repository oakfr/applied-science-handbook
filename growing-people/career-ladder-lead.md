# Career ladder for the Applied Science Lead

The goal of this document is to lay out a clear and simple career path for Applied Scientists Lead. We build this career path on the same premise as the Applied Scientist one: the gist of the career path is defined by the scale of your work, keeping in mind that your mission, at any level, is to impact customers in a significant and positive way. Each step in the ladder should correspond to a significant change in scale.

We therefore build the career path on the same foundation as the scale of Applied Scientists. The career path of a lead differs from that of an IC, however, as we will see in the rest of this document.

|   | Position (IC) | Position (Lead) | Scale of your ownership/impact |
| - | ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ | 
| S1       | Applied Scientist | | Solution that show value under supervision |
| S2  | Applied Scientist 2 | | New solution end-to-end in full autonomy |
| S3 | Senior Applied Scientist | Applied Science Lead | Solution at the scale of a product |
| S4 | Staff Applied Scientist | Staff Applied Science Lead | Solutions across multiple products |
| S5 | Principal Applied Scientist | Principal Applied Science Lead | Solutions that change the company trajectory |
| S6 | Staff Principal Applied Scientist | Staff Principal Applied Science Lead | Solutions that change the direction of the field |

While an Applied Scientist must develop hands-on skills, a Lead must develop a T-shape set of skills: horizontally, the ability to see the bigger picture and think strategically; vertically, the ability to dive deep into the research work. Beyond all, a Lead leads by example: they inspire Applied Scientists to do great work and the best way to do this is to show them the way.



In short, an Applied Scientist Lead excels in three area:

1. **Scientific Contributions:** this person must shine as an example by their past work and their scientific drive with their team. They will continue to make direct contributions themselves through side projects and more often, by influencing the work in their team with unique ideas. The goal of our team is also to impact the community in a positive way. This person must therefore shine through their contributions to the external world (publications, talks, open-source)
2. **Leadership & People Management:** this person must be passionate about growing people in their team. Applied Scientists often need dedicated and deep attention due the low predictability of their work.
3. **Product and business acumen:** we are a product-centric and customer-centric company. Therefore, our work should strive to impact the product significantly. This person must therefore deeply care about the product and the business.


## Leveling in a nutshell


L3. Senior Applied Scientist Lead
At this level:
- You manage the link with the product and the business, influence OKR decisions and follow-through customer escalations autonomously.
- You manage your team effectively, making sure that everyone is working with a clear goal and delivers at their level, in a collaborative and cross-functional manner. Your team hits its goals consistently.
- You participate in the scientific discussions of your team and provide useful feedback to the team. You contribute to the Applied Science scientific progress (paper reading group, knowledge sharing).


L4. Staff Applied Scientist Lead
At this level:
- You have significant influence on the trajectory of the product and the business. Without your influence, the product would have gone in a different direction. 
- You are growing your team, have successfully guided several of your reports to promotion and show concrete examples of how you have raised the bar in your team. 
- You contribute novel research ideas, either through your own research or by being actively involved in your team's projects. We must be able to identify your individual contributions to the project. You have generated new ideas that impacted the Product in a significant way. You contribute to external publications.


L5. Principal Applied Scientist Lead
At this level:
- You have shaped the direction of a product entirely. You participate in customer-facing meetings.
- You have bootstrapped a team from scratch or rebuilt a team with new principles. You have consistently raised the bar in your team.
- You make unique scientific contributions to your team (either individually or in a collaborative manner).  You lead external publication efforts.


L6. Staff Principal Applied Scientist Lead
At this level:
- You are at the origin of entirely new products.
- You have consistently grown several teams. Other leads come to you for mentoring.
- You drive major external publications (CVPR-level).


Note: to impact multiple products, a lead does not need to effectively lead multiple products at once. This principle would make most promotions unlikely, as a lead can hardly lead more than one product at once. However, a lead may work on a product as a "major" and "minor" into a second/third product.  With some experience, their work on the "minor" could bring radical improvements to the product even with limited time commitment.


## Core Impact Drivers

The core impact drivers of a lead build on top of those of an applied scientists. In the table below, we show the impact drivers of Applied Scientists as a reference in italics.

|  |  |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| **Technical Drivers** | **Research Drivers** |
| *Computer vision* <br> *Machine learning* <br> *Statistics* <br> Coding <br> For Leads: Solid foundations on the above | *Ability to conduct independent research (find & generate ideas)* <br> *Ability to explore (breadth & depth)*<br> *Presentation and writing* <br> *Structured thinking (how to split a problem into sub-problems)* <br> Raise the bar for your team. Ask hard questions and follow-through. <br> Lead by example in your own writing and presentations.<br> Lead a research topic yourself and show creativity <br> Watch the scientific space<br> Contribute to the community: talks, publications, open-source
|
| **Product and Delivery** | **People Drivers** |
| Deploying & monitoring ML systems <br> Product, market and customers understanding <br> The hacker mindset <br> The finisher mindset <br> Make your work known (buzz) | Working in a cross-functional environment <br> Willingness to learn & teach (mentoring) <br> Courage to challenge others and to be challenged <br> Self-introspection |

How to build a development plan
The career ladder and impact drivers should be the scaffolding to help you grow in your career as an Applied Scientist Lead. For the sake of clarity, we do not map each driver to each level. Each individual may find various ways of leveraging these drivers to unlock a given level. However, all these drivers are critical for an Applied Scientist Lead. In the end, we should be able to build a curriculum that helps everyone develop them. A lot of it comes from practice with more experienced colleagues (hence the focus on mentoring/coaching). But we should also provide resources such as internal and external training, reading lists, etc. 

Each Applied Scientist should be able to self-introspect and build their own profile. This would help them identify their strengths and weaknesses, which would in turn help them build a plan with their manager to move from one level to the next.



How we define and measure impact
Good Applied Science at Onfido = Impactful Applied Science: Effort is eventually materialised into an uplift in the Company North Star KPI and related metrics

Time to Impact matters: for each effort there is a time span until tangible impact is observed. As long as impact is not observed there is uncertainty by definition, and the value of the effort should be discounted accordingly. We propose the following categories:

Impact was measured
E.g.: successful abtest on a proposed improvement, experiment time reduction through automation, rescuing value at risk for a client through an ad-hoc effort
Value: the measured impact
Impact to be measured soon
E.g.: solution improvement in progress, offline results promising, preparing for A/B test
Value: zero yet, just wait for measurement to earn credit
Impact not measurable soon
E.g.: publish paper at NeurIPS, became go-to person for looker questions, team spirit behaviour, growth mindset, being autonomous (hence increasing effort capacity of AS team), etc.
Value: TBD. the only thing we can do here is align between leads on the relative value of each of those efforts compared to the measured impact, and be explicit about it. This is where we shape the incentives for applied scientists to decide where they want to put their effort.


About Onfido values
In the Applied Science team, we operate along the Onfido values like every other team: Succeed Together, Customer Buzz, Take Pride, Learn Things Share Them, Find a Better Way.

However we look at them through a higher-level lens by asking ourselves a simple question: do you care?

Do you care about your colleagues?
Do you care about our customers?
Do you care about the ML community?
Do you care about yourself?
 This lens is particularly powerful, because it is easy to frame and to answer by example, while being open to a large variety of ways to impact Onfido.
