# Career ladder for the Applied Scientist

Everyone in their career is looking for a clear career path. Over the years, I discovered that building a clear, simple and actionable career path for applied scientists was hard. I spent a significant amount thinking about it and came up with the one described in this chapter. It is currently in use at Onfido. 

 

This path should help everyone answer questions such as : 

- How am I doing at my current level? 
- What is expected from me to move to the next level? What am I missing right now? 
- Why did Alice get promoted and Bob did not? 
- What steps should I take to progress in my career? 

 

One of the core components of the career path revolves around mentoring and coaching. Indeed, one of the best ways to become a great applied scientist is through practice with peers who are better than us. This requires to instil a culture of mentoring in the team. Everybody should seek mentorship, starting at level 1 where one actively seeks a mentor all the way up to levels above where one actively seeks people to mentor. 

 

## The career ladder 

 

The gist of the career path is defined by the scale of your work, keeping in mind that your mission, at any level, is to impact customers in a significant and positive way. Each step in the ladder should correspond to a significant change in scale. 

 

 

 
Mission: Impact customers significantly and positively 
	

| Position | Title | Scale of your ownership/impact |
| ---------| ------ | ------------------------ | 
| S1       | Applied Scientist | Solution that show value under supervision |
| S2  | Applied Scientist 2 | New solution end-to-end in full autonomy |
| S3 | Senior Applied Scientist | Solution at the scale of a product |
| S4 | Staff Applied Scientist | Solutions across multiple products |
| S5 | Principal Applied Scientist | Solutions that change the company trajectory |
| S6 | Staff Principal Applied Scientist | Solutions that change the direction of the field |



S1.  At this stage, you build solutions that show value for the products. You require some level of supervision from more senior people around you. However, you can autonomously operate all the tools and processes of the applied scientist. You show deep interest in the impact on customers by looking at production monitoring and suggesting new ideas. The projects you work on go to production and move the needle on key metrics. You participate in the OKR definition. You actively seek a mentor from higher levels. 

 

S2. At this stage, you can autonomously build end-to-end solutions and lead the effort to ship them to Production, hand-in-hand with Engineering. You lead by example on production monitoring and customer impact. You bring new ideas to the team and demonstrate the ability to adapt solutions from literature to specific business problems, and/or raise the team level by sharing research knowledge. You interact with PMs in a fruitful way and influence the OKR and roadmap definition. You mentor S1-level people and help them grow. To fully operate at this level, you have collected a number of impactful projects already. 

 

S3. At this stage, you build new architectures at the scale of an entire product. You are able to build and dive deep into the most complex models in the team. Your ideas impact the trajectory of the product with positive outcomes, visible at the customer level. You initiate and push brand new, impactful initiatives at the scale of the whole Applied Science team. You are considered as a go-to person by Engineering and Product and help resolve cross-team issues. Your vision leads to brand new OKRs. You mentor S2-level people and help them grow.  

 

S4. At this stage, you impact multiple products at once.  You drive multi-people research projects, with a significant impact on the product and the business. You are still hands-on and can dive deep into the most complex models across multiple products. You interact with senior product managers and shape the vision and the roadmap of the Product. You set a new standard for the way people work: methodology, approach, critical thinking. You influence people with visible results on the outcome of their work. You have a track record of leading defining changes to the Applied Science team at large. You mentor S3-level people and help them grow.  

 

S5. At this stage, you are a leader in applied science within the company. Your vision impacts the trajectory of the company. You have gained a full understanding of the field and drive initiatives that impact the direction of the other departments.  You provide deep and valuable insights in the research discussions. You drive multi-people projects to completion with a disruptive impact for our customers. You are a go-to person for Applied Science across the company. You mentor S4-level people and help them grow. 

 

S6. At this stage, you are a recognized leader in the field outside of the company. Your vision impacts the domain outside of the company. You speak at top-tier venues and interact with world-class experts outside of the company. Your vision shapes the trajectory of the company. You mentor S5-level people and help them grow. 

 

## Core Impact Drivers 

The Applied Scientist role involves specific drivers that should translate into impact. Although we acknowledge possessing those drivers is a fundamental prerequisite for the role, we purposely value the impact that you have in the company as an applied scientist.  In this section we describe the main impact drivers that we can use to assess how well you are performing. Instead of mapping impact drivers to each level (like is being done in the matrix), we prefer to deep dive into each of them and explain how one can develop them. 

 

Applied Scientists seek to excel at the following: 
- Ability to conduct independent research 
- Ability to work with others 
- Experience delivering ML to production 
- A strong appetite for product and customers 

 

Domain expertise in your companyâ€™s domain is a nice-to-have but not a requirement for a newcomer (independently of seniority). You develop this expertise as time goes. On the other hand, domain expertise in computer vision & machine learning is a must-have and grows over time. 

 

From a practical perspective, here are the drivers that an Applied Scientist develops.   

 

| Technical Drivers | Research Drivers |
| Computer vision <br> Machine learning <br> Statistics <br> Coding <br> | 
Ability to conduct independent research (find & generate ideas) <br>
Ability to explore (breadth & depth)<br>
Presentation and writing <br>
Structured thinking (how to split a problem into sub-problems) <br> |

    Courage to challenge others and to be challenged 

    Self-introspection 

 

## How to build a development plan 

The career ladder and impact drivers should be the scaffolding to help you grow in your career as an applied scientist. For the sake of clarity, we do not map each driver to each level. Each individual may find various ways of leveraging these drivers to unlock a given level. However, all these drivers are critical for an Applied Scientist. In the end, we should be able to build a curriculum that helps everyone develop them. A lot of it comes from practice with more experienced colleagues (hence the focus on mentoring/coaching). But we should also provide resources such as internal and external training, reading lists, etc.  

 

Each Applied Scientist should be able to self-introspect and build their own profile. This would help them identify their strengths and weaknesses, which would in turn help them build a plan with their manager to move from one level to the next. 

 

## How we define and measure impact 

**Good Applied Science = Impactful Applied Science**: Effort is eventually materialised into an uplift in the Company North Star KPI and related metrics. 

 

**Time to Impact matters**: for each effort there is a time span until tangible impact is observed. If impact is not observed there is uncertainty by definition, and the value of the effort should be discounted accordingly. We propose the following categories: 

 
1. Impact was measured 
    * E.g.: successful AB test on a proposed improvement, experiment time reduction through ML, rescuing value at risk for a client through an ad-hoc effort 
    * Value: the measured impact 

2. Impact to be measured soon 
    * E.g.: solution improvement in progress, offline results promising, preparing for A/B test 
    * Value: zero yet, just wait for measurement to earn credit 

3. Impact not measurable soon
    * E.g.: publish paper at a top conference, became go-to person for ML questions, team spirit behaviour, growth mindset, being autonomous (hence increasing effort capacity of the Applied Science team), etc. 
    * Value: the only thing we can do here is align between leads on the relative value of each of those efforts compared to the measured impact and be explicit about it. This is where we shape the incentives for applied scientists to decide where they want to put their effort.
