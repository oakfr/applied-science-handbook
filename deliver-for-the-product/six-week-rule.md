# The Six Week Rule

Research projects are notoriously hard to manage: they often fail, they are not predictable, and they can sometimes succeed after weeks or months of doldrums.

Over time, I have found a recipe that works quite well to manage research projects.

The Six-Week Rule consists in giving your best shot to the project for six weeks.

After six weeks, you should see *some* light at the end of the tunnel.

If you don't see anything, more often than not, this means that something is flawed in the setup: there might be a bug in the code, or one of the fundamental hypothesis of the idea is broken.

One way of looking at it is to ask the scientist working on the project the following question: "how can you frame your project in a six-week time window?"

If the answer is "I can't", then maybe the scientist needs help to divide-and-conquer their project.

It is also an efficient way to streamline an idea to its simplest form and to remove unncessary parts of the project.

Now, there *are* situations where the six-week rule does not apply: sometimes, you need months of darkness before seeing the light.

I would advise to allocate these projects very carefully and to leave it in the hands of highly experienced researchers.

Why six and not two or 8 or 12?  That's a fair question.  I have found six two work well: not too short that it'd create outstanding pressure on the scientist, and not too long that the scientist would lose sight on what question they are trying to answer.

Also, six weeks happens to be half a quarter, so that's easy for project tracking.

The general principle is that research projects are hard (if impossible) to plan ahead.  Better to let ideas sparkle in all directions.  The six-week rules allows you to do this in a managed fashion.
