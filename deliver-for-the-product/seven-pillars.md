# The seven pillars of Applied AI

The mission of an Applied AI is to impact customers in a positive and significant way through science.

This document lays out how we do it in practice.  It is inspired by the hybrid research model developed by Google.


## 1. Work on important problems for the Product


The first thing we should do, as researchers, is to make sure that we are working on important problems. This means:

Evaluate as quickly as possible whether your idea is moving the needle for the Product. Assume it does not until proven otherwise.
Regularly look at production data, because this will give you a unique perspective on what the customers’ problems are.  
Develop a deep understanding of the domain to understand the ins and outs of it, looking at the product, the business and the technology at the same time. Only when we do that do we get the big picture and understand what the important problems are.  
Develop genuine curiosity and ask why things are the way they are.  

None of this is easy, but there is no free lunch.  Working on an important problem should be your single most important concern when you start a new project.


## 2. Get the data right


Good research starts with a robust approach to data collection and management.

Make sure the data is adequate and of good quality
Proactively get for more data if needed (we have agency and budgets)
Trace the data with a dataset management tool, i.e. the Data Access Service
Make your experiments reproducible (scripts, links, documentation)


## 3. Be agile in the code


Researchers should strive to write production-grade (or close to production-grade) code. If you’re not agile in the code, you’re sitting under a glass ceiling.  You are restrained to pure experimentation with a high risk of things not panning out.

Work hand-in-hand with the engineering team from day one. The default setup is a hybrid engineering/research team focused on a Product.
Hack things around. The best is the enemy of the good. Prove your point as fast as you can.
If you’re not at the right level, learn (if you don’t know where to start, look around for people who just did, and ask them how they did it)
Choose projects that will force you to learn to be agile in the code.


## 4. Manage your time ruthlessly


Research is hard and requires a ruthless approach to time management. 

Use the maker’s schedule.  
Turn off notifications. If you ask me, I’ll say that having slack notifications turned on, as a researcher, is pure insanity.  You should turn off all notifications (at the exception, maybe, of the calendar, because, heck, it sucks to miss an important meeting).  Everything else should be turned off.  Every interruption costs you 25’ of context switching.  Do that 12 times a day.  You do the maths to guess what’s left for productive work. 


## 5. Learn to communicate effectively


Doing great research is not enough.  You must convey your results effectively.  This means:

Write effective exec summaries at the beginning of each major doc.
Make your work discoverable despite the dismal performance of the confluence search engine (i.e. name/organise your confluence pages properly). 
Target an audience that is not Applied Science.  Write for engineering, write for Product, write for the exec team. 

90% of the work is Research. If you miss on the 10% of write-up, you get a 0% return.



## 6. Build leverage


If you work alone on your project and everything goes well, you get a 1X return.  If you work with people who have leverage, you get a 10X return. What do I mean by people with leverage?  I mean people who can help you turn your 1X into 10X for the company.  Here are a few examples (any resemblance to actual situations is totally intended).  

You have found a brand new approach to doc fraud.  You have a POC.  That’s a 1X return so far. Now, you identify the analytics person who could help you measure the impact for the product, and the engineering person who can help you estimate the go-to-prod strategy. That’s leverage.
You’ve built an MLOps service that lets users version datasets/models and the link between the two.  That’s a 1X improvement. Now, you identify the person who just built a new awesome data sourcing library for the team, and you incorporate your service into their library as a default option.  That’s leverage. 

You get the idea.  Find leverage. Build long-lasting relationships with people around you.  Spend long periods of time in the same domain. The magic of compounding will do the rest.


## 7. Optimize for adoption


Our goal is to move the needle for our end users, whether on the internet or inside the company.  Whatever we do, communicating around our work is important, but unfortunately not enough.  The end game is adoption, i.e. people actually using what we build.  This means that communication/diffusion is not a goal in and of itself, but a means to an end.  You are free to use whatever works best, as long you drive adoption.
