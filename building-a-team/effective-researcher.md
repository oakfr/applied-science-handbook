# The effective researcher

This chapter enters a deep discussion into what is AI Research and the meaning of our work. 

There is hardly any shortcut for such an important question.  The analysis goes deep into what our mission is as a team, and what this means for us as individuals.  I suggest that the problem we are facing is not new, and that inspiring leaders from the past have already thought about this question.  There are things we can learn from them and transform into practical recommendations. 

 

The gist of this chapter relies on two pillars: caring about what we do, and building a consistent process.  This seems general at first, so we’ll deep dive into what we mean exactly. But in the end, this is what it is about: If you really care about what you do and build a solid process around it, you will deliver great things and enjoy your work.  But if you don’t do this, you are on the drunken sailor trajectory, and I cannot promise you anything else than a random walk. 

 

## On Science and Engineering: there are no plans, there are only processes 

 

In the words of Richard Hamming in Learning to Learn, “Now I need to discuss science versus engineering. Science, if you are doing it, you shouldn't know what you're doing. If you know what you're doing, you shouldn't be doing it. Not in science, because science is supposed to be exploration. But you don't know. Engineering. You shouldn't be doing it unless you do know what you're doing. Well, nothing is pure. Science involves a great deal of engineering. And engineering involves a great deal of new material. So it's a great blend. But what is painful to you is going to be worse, is that these two fields are growing together because of a simple fact. Again, going back by first candy Bell Labs, when suddenly we discovered in physics. The telephone company was not in that greater hurry to get it developed it into the field, after all have pretty much monopoly, why hurry? Now as you know, we are not willing to wait for scientific principles to develop we want the field tomorrow. So two fields to come together like that.” 

 

People often equate engineering with incremental research. What Hamming is telling us here is that, standalone research is incremental.  Revolutionary things happen when we connect the dots between the product, the engineering and the research world.  Then, we become hackers in a positive sense, and good things start to happen. 

 

 

Engineering comes with constraints, but also with power. Engineering is where things scale and touch the customer. And so, the first thing we should do as Applied Scientists is to be at ease with the engineering world. 

 

The catch is that Research and Engineering differ fundamentally in the way they operate. While Engineering work can be planned and predicted well, Research cannot.  There is no such thing as a “plan” in Applied Science.  There are only processes. While there exists a notion of RFC in Engineering, there is no such thing in Applied Science.  You can build the best RFC in the world for your research project.  Three days later, you make a new discovery, and your shiny RFC is now down the drain.  The only thing you have left to lock onto is a process. 

 

What process are we talking about?  We will answer this question shortly, but before we do this, we must listen to two giants who came before us.  Together, they embody the duality of Engineering and Research. 

 

## The engineer: Seymour Cray 

 

Called "the father of supercomputing", Seymour Cray has been credited with creating the supercomputer industry. He founded Cray Research and had an immense impact on the industry.  

 

Cray was an amazing thinker, designer and inventor. But he quickly led teams and devised a way of working that consistently worked well for his company.  

 

Cray did not really bother to write management books. But he did leave a legacy behind him. People remember how he worked.  

 

Just around the GooglePex in MountainView sits the Museum of Computer Science. The museum has a section dedicated to Seymour Cray, where a short video tells us about Seymour’s modus operandi. Seymour operated along three principles. 

 

### Start fresh with each new project 

Seymour started every new project from the blank sheet (literally, since his work started on paper). This did not mean “rebuild everything from scratch”. What it really means is, start from a blank sheet at the design phase, going back to first principles. Starting from a blank sheet helps scratching hypotheses that no longer hold, as well as outdated technologies. Another formulation of it is: “Assume nothing”. SpaceX revolutionised space travel because they reassessed everything in rocket design. 

  

### Design simply using proven technologies.   

By proven technology, we mean technology that has been tried and tested over many years. This seems to go against the intuition that research should be about unproven technologies. And indeed, research is about exploring unproven territory. But in the end, it must end as tried-and-tested technology in our product. Which means that we’re not done until the “unproven technology” we discovered is now robustly integrated into our product. 

  

### Work in small groups with a single decision-maker.  

This is about working in small, cross-functional teams (product, engineering, analytics, research, UI/UX).  

 

The bottom line is that Cray had devised a process that worked well for his team.  I am not saying we should try to replicate it.  I am saying that we should strive to reach the same level of clarity in the way we work. 

 

 

## The researcher: Richard Hammings 

 

Richard W. Hamming was a scientist and mathematician whose work inspired a generation of engineers, scientists, and researchers. He is best known for discovering mathematical formulas that allow computers to correct their own errors, a fundamental function of modems, compact disks, and satellite communications. 

 

Born in Chicago in 1915, he provided crucial programming support as a member of the Manhattan Project. After World War II, he joined Bell Labs, where over the next 15 years he was involved in nearly all of its most prominent achievements. He later taught and lectured at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. Throughout his career, Hamming received many awards for his work, including the Turing Award in 1968, the highest honor in computer science. In 1988, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers created the Richard W. Hamming Medal in his honour, of which he was the first recipient. He died in 1998. 

 

At a seminar in the Bell Communications Research Colloquia Series, Dr. Richard W. Hamming, a Professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California and a retired Bell Labs scientist, gave a very interesting and stimulating talk, `You and Your Research' to an overflow audience of some 200 Bellcore staff members and visitors at the Morris Research and Engineering Center on March 7, 1986. This talk centered on Hamming's observations and research on the question ``Why do so few scientists make significant contributions and so many are forgotten in the long run?'' From his more than forty years of experience, thirty of which were at Bell Laboratories, he has made a number of direct observations, asked very pointed questions of scientists about what, how, and why they did things, studied the lives of great scientists and great contributions, and has done introspection and studied theories of creativity. The talk is about what he has learned in terms of the properties of the individual scientists, their abilities, traits, working habits, attitudes, and philosophy. 

 

The speech is full of insights.  Since it is quite long, I have extracted the key takeaways below.   

 

Have courage and drive. “That is the characteristic of great scientists; they have courage. They will go forward under incredible circumstances; they think and continue to think [...] Great scientists have tremendous drive. Solid work, steadily applied, gets you surprisingly far.” 

 

Work on important problems.  “You should be asking yourself: What are the important problems in my field?  Now, on the definition of important problems. We didn't work on (1) time travel, (2) teleportation, and (3) antigravity. They are not important problems because we do not have an attack. It's not the consequence that makes a problem important, it is that you have a reasonable attack.” 

 

Be emotionally involved. Seek contradictions. “Darwin writes in his autobiography that he found it necessary to write down every piece of evidence which appeared to contradict his beliefs because otherwise they would disappear from his mind.” You should only feel comfortable about your opinion if you can express your opponent’s opinion better than they do. 

 

Work with others. “The essence of science is cumulative.” Seek feedback and comments on your work. Do pair research. Build tools for the team. 

 

Learn to work with the system. Don’t find alibis. "It is a poor workman who blames his tools - the good man gets on with the job, given what he's got, and gets the best answer he can."  Complaining about what does not work is a healthy thing. But we need to go one step further: don’t procrastinate on a task because the experience of it is poor. Fix the experience. Fix the process. 

 

Learn to sell your work. “I have now come down to a topic which is very distasteful; it is not sufficient to do a job, you have to sell it. [...] You have to learn to write clearly and well so that people will read it, you must learn to give reasonably formal talks, and you also must learn to give informal talks.”  I will extend this advice with How to speak, by Patrick Winston. 

 

Richard Hamming also delivered a course on Science and Engineering, which can be found in the book The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn (also in pdf here) as well as in this introductory speech. We leave this part for your own reading list. 

 

## What does this mean for us Applied Scientists? 

 

From all this, we can extract a few lessons about how we should work as Applied Scientists.  Like I said earlier, it is about two things: caring about what we do and building a process around it.  From there, we devised [seven principles](../deliver-for-the-product/seven-pillars.md) for an Applied AI team.
