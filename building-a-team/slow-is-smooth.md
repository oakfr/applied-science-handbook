# Slow is smooth, smooth is fast

There is a well-known saying in the Navy SEALS which goes like this: slow is smooth, smooth is fast.  The first time I read this sentence, it did not make any sense to me.  Those who go to the Navy learn it quickly and the hard way.  The others (like me) also learn it, but much more slowly and over many years of experience. 


What this saying entails is that when stakes are high and the pressure is high, the natural tendency is to rush things, leading to mistakes.  In the military, this has life/death implications.  In tech, it can have dramatic consequences for the company.  Organizational change fails when companies move too quickly, skipping fundamental elements such as aligned vision and culture. They run to their death and the change process eventually stalls. 

 

Moving fast means, for example, that taking the time to articulate our ideas and writing things down is not worth it. Unfortunately, this has the inverse consequences of the intended effect.  We have the impression of moving fast, but we move slower in the long term.  Why?  Because we lose track of the decisions we make and the architectures we build.  Several months down the road, this bites us in the back and sadly, it does it silently because we do not see what is lacking.  We only feel that something is lacking but we fail to see what. 

 

In the end, this is not only about efficiency.  It's about building better relationships between Applied Science and Engineering and improving the way humans connect between the two. 

 

A few things you should be doing to make your team efficient: 

- Share information, early and consistently 
- Build a rock-solid infrastructure 
- Write things down, early and consistently 
- Pair engineers and researchers to maintain a continuous alignment 
- Use the same codebase for research and production 
- Make things reproducible
