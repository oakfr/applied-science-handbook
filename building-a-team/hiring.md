# Hiring a scientist

Your best asset is your people. Hiring should be top of mind for you all the time, even when you are not officially hiring. As one of our recruiters used to put it at Onfido: you should put hiring in the oven.

Hiring is also one of the hardest things in the world: it takes a tremendous amount of time and energy to find and recruit great people.

Here are a few tips that I found to work well to hire in the Applied AI space.

## Approach candidates yourself
- A great recruiter is always useful, but great candidates will value being approached by a member of the team directly.
- It takes one to get one. There is no recipe for finding great scientists.  As a scientist, you are best placed to find your peers.

## Train the recruiter by example
- Good candidates come from all backgrounds. There is no recipe for recruiters to follow.
- Your best option is to train your recruiter by showing them great people you hired and what your thought process was when you selected them.
- Some of your best hires will fly under the radar of basic filters (ivy-league school, ivy-leave companies, top-notch kaggle scores)

## Hire passively
- Great scientists spot your company by looking at your publications, talks and open-source contributions.
- Give to the community, and the community shall give back!

## Build a layered interview pipeline
- Your recruiting process should go deep into the tech skills of the candidate (see next point)
- Therefore, the recruiting process will take a toll on your team
- Put a layered process in place: recruiter -> screening -> panel
- The screening should be 1h long and consist of a large set of questions giving you a birds-eye view of the candidate
- Only move to the panel candidates that did reasonably well at the screening stage

## Build reproducibility, optimize for measurement
- Make your process robust to leakage (because it will leak): build a solid bank of questions and coding problems that you can swith to
- Spend time with your team building the coding problems and interview questions: they are defining of your culture and will be perceived as such by the candidate.
- As much as possible, use the same interviewer for the same interview: they will be able to compare candidates with each other.
- Define a clear scorecard for each interview: what is a red flag, what is a minimum requirement, etc.
- Avoid coding problems that have a single bright solution. They won't teach you much and will be frustrated for candidates who are stuck. 
- Instead, use simple exercises (e.g. 3-sum) and juice out as much as you can from them.

## Go deep into the tech skills
- Over-invest in coding: scientists who are poor at coding will be a liability in your team
- Avoid homework: this is obnoxious for candidates and does not tell you much in the era of Generative AI
- OTOH, asking your candidate to bring a paper for an open discussion can be useful. The very choice of the paper is a signal in and on itself.
- The panel should be involved and consist of 4-5 interviews covering coding, deep learning skills, fundamentals of statistics, experience shipping ML to production and experience working with Product teams

## Don't try to evaluate soft skills directly
- I've always found "soft-skills" interviews weird and useless.  They are often too easy to game
- Soft-skills interviews are also time wasted that you could have used for hard skill evaluation
- Soft skills are usually better evaluated as a by-product of the tech skills interviews: there's a lot of weak signal that you can collect throughout the process
- In particular, how *collaborative* the candidate was at each step of the process is useful signal

## Treat your candidates carefully
- Candidates that don't join your company are the voice of your company afterwards.
- Great candidates are sometimes rejected once, only to get hired one or two years later.  They won't re-apply if their first experience with your company was bad.

## Interviews are two-way streets
- Use interviews to show what your team looks like: people, projects, ceremonies, etc.
- Always give 5-10 min to the candidate to ask questions at the end of each interview.
- Be as transparent as you can on everything: the org, the projects, your culture, etc.
