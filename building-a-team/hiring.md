# Hiring a scientist

Your best asset is your people. Hiring should be top of mind for you all the time. Even when you are not officially hiring. As our recruiter at Onfido used to put it: you should put hiring in the oven.

Hiring is also one of the hardest things in the world: it takes a tremendous amount of time and energy to find and recruit great people.

## Approach candidates yourself

## Train the recruiter by example
- Good candidates come from all backgrounds
- Weak signals

## Build a layered interview pipeline
- Recruiter -> Screening -> Panel
- Screening is a hard set of questions (Deepmind style)

## Go deep into the tech skills
- Two coding interviews
- Bring a paper

## Don't try to evaluate soft skills directly

## Avoid homework

## Treat your candidates carefully
