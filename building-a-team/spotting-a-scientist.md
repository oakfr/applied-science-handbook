# How to spot a great scientist in 3 minutes!

The previous section described a detailed process for hiring applied scientists. Yet, sometimes, you also need to make an on-the-spot judgment call as to whether a candidate would be worthy of your time, e.g. meeting someone at random during a conference. 

 

The candidate might be boasting a great publication track record, an amazing Kaggle rank or a fantastic multi-star github repository. All of these are tell-tales of a great candidate, but how would you dig deeper in a few minutes? 

 

In my opinion, there are three traits that you should be looking for: curiosity, resilience, and an open mind.  

 

After many years of looking for these traits, I found one question that worked well as a proxy for them: “tell me about a hard problem you had to solve, and how you solved it”. And then use the time you have to dig into their answer. This single question will often last the whole interview. 

 

Some will say: “but that works only for senior folks, how do you do it for junior folks?” 

 

The reality is that you can apply this principle at the intern level, and it still works. 

 

I once interviewed candidates for an internship. Candidates had nothing to show but one or two months of experience, that was it. Yet, one of the candidates caught my attention. 

 

First, he had travelled quite a bit to get to his internship location (resilience). Then, as he arrived, he discovered that the company was in a complete storm and had nothing for him to do. He decided to stay put and find the most useful thing he could do for the company that would still look like machine learning work (resilience hits again). 

 

He talked to the product teams (curiosity) and discovered a problem that, if solved, could help the business significantly. He did not know where and how to start, so he asked around, did a ton of literature review (open mind) and short-listed a few algorithms. A few months later, his solution was out in production and had made an impact at the scale of the company. 

 

We hired him. Unsurprisingly, he made a killing during his internship in our team. 

 

This is just one data point, but I found this approach to work well over time. Again, you should run your candidates through the whole hiring process, but this tell-tale interview is often a good proxy for success. 

 

This question is powerful, for three reasons: 

 

1. It brings the best out of the candidate, no matter what their background is. If I’m not convinced by the answer, there is little chance I’d be convinced by something else. 

 

2. It makes for a truly genuine and interesting discussion. I often find myself discovering surprising things while interviewing candidates this way. 

 

3. It is hard to game. Applied AI involves many areas across machine learning, statistics, distributed computing and software engineering. Being able to handle a deep conversation across these domains matters. 

 

So, that’s the question I ask. And whenever I have a few minutes to spend with a prospective candidate, I use them to see which hard problem they had to solve!
