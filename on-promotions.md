# On promotions

Some of you are asking questions about promotions.  These questions are fair.  If anything, the simple fact that you are asking is reassuring.  It means that you care.  And as you will see in a moment, caring gets you 50% of the way.

If you read things as they are “by the book”, people will tell you that you get promoted “if you are operating at the next level consistently”.  This is true, but it is not very actionable.  It does matter to have a notion of what each level is about, which is what is laid out in the Applied Scientist Career Path. But we’re trying to be more pragmatic here.

So here is how things work, put in simple terms. You get promoted if you give a shit and deliver. 

Now, delivering in a research environment is hard.  You may say: there is uncertainty and so I cannot guarantee delivery every single time.  And that is absolutely true.  But if you follow a process, you will deliver on average, and consistently. Your batting average will improve over time.  In the end, you will deliver a few major breakthroughs in a year, and that’s all you need.  We’re talking game-changing things (at your level).  And that’s what your goal should be.

So the updated version becomes: you get promoted if you give a shit and follow a consistent process. Simple. Can I elaborate?  For sure, that’s what I did here.

Now, on to more practical questions.



“You need to operate at the next level consistently” seems too hard of a criteria 

People may say: this is unfair, I’ve been operating at the next level for the past few months already, or I’m 90% there.  The problem is known as Peter's principle.  Essentially, being too lenient on this leads to people being over-promoted, which yields a number of deep problems.  And so, we’re not doing anyone a favour by promoting people too early.  The only way to know it is to see it.  Now, when you look at an S3 or S4 around you, you know you’re talking to an S3 (or an S4). That’s how stellar teams operate.



## Promotions are rare

Yes, they are.  There are only so many levels in the ladder.  Assuming you are at Level 1 today, you have 5 levels to go.  You will take many years to get there.  Level 6 is a top-notch, international-grade player.  Assuming you reach it at age 45 and are 25 today, that’s an average of three years at each level.  In reality, the promotion speed is faster at the beginning and slower at the end, so you will typically stay a few years at Level 1, a few more years at Level 2, and so on. Of course, this is a general observation.  Sometimes someone will jump quickly from one level to the next, sometimes they will stay longer, making slow but steady progress.  All this means that you should be comfortable with spending quite a few years at a given level, which in turns means that you should be “onto something else than promotion” within a level (i.e. there is something else to life than getting promoted).



## Some people seem to be stuck at their level for years.

Indeed, read the manual described above.  If you don’t give a shit, or don’t have a process, you’re on the drunken sailor trajectory.  Obviously, we all want to avoid this.  Our mission, as leads, is to put everyone on a solid trajectory.  But we cannot help you if you don’t help yourself in the first place.



## Why is the process not transparent?

The process is transparent, the individual stories aren’t.  Despite the big push for transparency (for a good reason), the general principle is that we should aim for transparency at the collective level, but respect privacy at the individual level. 

So how does the process work?  Senior leads from the Applied Science team get in a room and talk about each individual.  Based on recent past performance, we discuss and select candidates for promotion.  We hone in on those people, and decide whether they should be promoted or not.  When people are not promoted, we give them feedback as to why and provide leads to fix what’s missing.  Your promotion is not initiated (or confirmed) by your lead only.  Other leads can intervene, which makes the process more fair (or more regularised, if you will). This gets you out of a local minimum where a lead could be harsher than another.

This is how it works.  Is it fair?  We believe it is as fair as it could be.  Now, there is temporal variance: two people with similar trajectories could see a temporal difference in their promotion timeline.  This is due to the stochastic aspects of our life as a team.  Given that people spend several years on a given level on average, we should take it as it is and move on (obviously, our goal is to minimise this variance, though).

Now you may say “But Alice got lucky and worked on shiny projects while Bob did not!”.  The reality is that this happened because Alice searched for important problems to work on earlier on, while Bob did not.  You may argue that there is some luck to this, but on average over long periods of time, processes beat luck out of the equation entirely. So, search for important problems.



## Is it equally hard for a person working at company A to be promoted within the company to level X as it is to be hired at company B at level X?

It is slightly harder for a person to be hired at Level X from the outside than being promoted to Level X internally.  The reason is that we have less knowledge/confidence in the performance/strengths/weaknesses of an external hire, and so we need that person to meet a slightly higher bar than an internal person.  Think of it as a distribution over the person’s performance, where we want to promote the person with 95% confidence, and the distribution of an external hire is wider, so the mode needs to be higher.
